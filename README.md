# Presentation Log File Extraction
Log file extraction scripts from Neurobs Presentation log files.
This script uses [importPresentationLog.m](http://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28793-import-of-log-files-created-by-presentation?focused=5235630&tab=function) written by Tobias Otto. I, however, changed the script so it also takes the reaction times into account, which are saved at the end of the first block of logs.
